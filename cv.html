              I am a student studying Business Computing(Web Design) at the University of Northampton.
              I’ve worked part time as a swimming teacher and taught both young children and adults to swim and therefore find it easy to adjust my tone or language depending on the person I am speaking to. 
              Working at Haven head office demonstrates my communication skills as the job was based completely on customer service and I would speak to up to 80 customers a day.
